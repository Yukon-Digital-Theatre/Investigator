    Murderers Fled to Py-Conto
    CAPITAL – The International Criminal Court (ICC) has begun communications with Py-Conto about extraditing several high-profile military and government personnel believed to have played key roles in the genocide.
    
    Thousands of Samha loyal to the Golden Arm Party and the Samha military immigrated to Py-Conto immediately after the war. Most settled in the second largest town Ci-Liva. 
    
    There are several prominent Turion communities in Py-Conto from the diaspora of the 1700s. All have reported increases of hate crimes and raised concerns about anti-Turion organizations establishing themselves. They are urging the Py-Conto government to cooperate with the ICC and crack down on organizations which are pro-Golden Arm or anti-Turion.
